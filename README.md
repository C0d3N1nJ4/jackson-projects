## json-handling

The project demonstrates how to handle JSON data requests to a RESTful web service that will persist the data to an in-memory database (H2).
A response of 200-OK is returned with a message of "Data saved successfully" if the data is successfully persisted to the database.
If the request is invalid, a response of 400-Bad Request is returned with a message of "Invalid request".

The project uses the following technologies:
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 Database
- Jackson
- Lombok
- Maven
- Junit
- Mockito
- Swagger
